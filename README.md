## Projects / Repositories

- *Octoposh*: A Powershell Module for Octopus Deploy. [See more](https://github.com/dalmirog/OctoPosh/blob/master/POST_MORTEM.md)

- [Ludmila-Giorgelli/PythonLearning](https://github.com/Ludmila-Giorgelli/PythonLearning) a repository I'm using to teach my 17yo sister the basics of software development during the Covid-19 quarentine. She already had some experience writing simple scripts with a pseudo language called [PSEint](http://pseint.sourceforge.net/) from highschool, so we are taking that a step further by translating all the knowledge she already had to a real-world language like Python. We are also using this repo to help her get comfortable working with others using git.
